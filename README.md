# Neue Leseapp
Demonstration of some ideas for a possible reading app as part of my master’s thesis (https://martinlexow.de/blog/die-neue-softwaregestaltung).

* The app uses simple html files for the content it displays. 
* Superscript numbers will display footnotes in a special way. 
* Scrollbar changes its position based on its detection if you’re left or right-handed. 
* You can set a bookmark by using a long-tab. 
* The app has a darkmode implemented (use the settings to activate it). 
* Text will be displayed larger if the app detects heavy movement. 
* If the screens brightness is set to 100% it will trigger a special high-contrast mode for a better reading experience. 
* The app does respect all settings you may have made in the iOS settings like text size or bold text.
